    <header><h2>Our Mission</h2></header>
    <p>We at The Athletic Supporter have dedicated our lives to pursue our dream of having a foam hand of their favorite Sports Team on the hand of every citizen of this great nation. It's the right of everyone to claim that their Sports Team is number one, and with a foam hand, decorated with the logo and name of their favorite team, our customers are executing their First Amendment right to self-expression!</p>

    <header><h2>Our Corporate History</h2></header>
    <p>The story of The Athletic Supporter can be traced back several decades to the 1950's. It was in 1954 that our founder, Charles Zwiebel, got into a fist-fight while at a Brooklyn Dodgers game. The heated, vocal argument over whose team was number one gave Charles the inspiration to silently promote his love of his favorite team. Armed with only $2 and his dream, he created the first foam hand with index finger outstretched to denote "number one". Rumor has it that prototypes had the middle finger, but that's just crass speculation. To this day, The Athletic Supporter has been on the "bleeding-edge" of foam hand technology, bringing joy to children and adults alike.</p>

    <header><h2>Our Staff</h2></header>
    <p>Over the years, The Athletic Supporter has grown in leaps and bounds, from a staff of two in 1954, to currently eight employees. Our CEO is Randy Zweibel, the grandson of our founder. The CTO is Alex Newsome, formerly the head of research at Dupont. Alex joins us at a time when the foam hand market is ready to explode. Of course, you don't have to tell that to Mark Jones, our CFO. Mark forsees nothing but blue skies in the foam hand market. </p>
